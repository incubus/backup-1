      # To send notifications via Telegram you need:
      # 1. a bot who will send messages (created with the help of @BotFather bot via any Telegram client);
      # 2. a public channel messages will be sent to (channels are created via any Telegram client generally by starting a new message and selecting ‘New Channel’);
      # 3. add your bot to your channel as an administrator (only administrators can post messages to public channels)
      # You can also use a private channel or chat/group chat, but obtaininig chat id for it is a bit more complicated
      # (search for stackoverflow question: "How to obtain the chat_id of a private Telegram channel?")
      # Also please note that bots can not initiate conversations in Telegram, so your bot has to be manually added to channel/chat/group chat before it can send messages there.
